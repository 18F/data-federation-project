# Data Federation Project

# Background
Federated data refers to data that are aggregated across a number of organizations, departments or agencies at various scales.  Handling the volume, quality and completeness of data coming in from multiple sources is a common challenge for government agencies in charge of collecting and managing domain-specific information.  This project is an effort to smooth that process by providing ways to ingest data more easily, and provide real-time user feedback so that users can make corrections before it is submitted to a central repository.  

> Federated data efforts are increasingly seen as an engine for transparency, economic growth, and accountability, yet collecting that data remains a challenge. Despite the fact that efforts of this sort are increasing in frequency, each new effort is still improvising solutions in terms of processes, tooling, and compliance infrastructure. It's time to take this problem seriously and invest in reusable tools and approaches that will streamline federated data efforts in the years to come.

We suggest you first read the report, then explore the code and use cases. 

# Phase I: Report
This repository includes the [preliminary findings from the Data Federation Project](https://github.com/18F/data-federation-report/blob/master/PreliminaryFindings.md).

# Phase II: The code and first use cases
An early version of the django project that manages federated data [can be found here](https://github.com/18F/django-data-ingest).
