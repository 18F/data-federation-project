The 10x Data Federation team is getting ready to grow! In our first week back from the holidays, we prepared to welcome and onboard new team members starting next week.

## Completed

* Prepared to onboard new team members: 
  * Created a Project README 
  * Wrote personal READMEs for current team members
* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov repository
  * Scheduled follow-up conversation with OMB stakeholders to address opportunities to collaborate with CDO Council and Federal Data Strategy
  * Connected with GSA’s Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement to learn about GSA’s role in organizing the CDO Council
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Had intro conversation with contact at HUD to evaluate an additional possible use case for ReVAL
  * Reached out to FNS to tell us when to start scheduling calls with states
  
## Up next

* Meet with OMB and other stakeholders to get feedback and align on next steps
* Interview SSA CDO and former Data Exchange COP organizer Laura Train
* Onboard Princess Ojiaku & (hopefully) new engineer
* Define project tasks for remainder of Phase 4 and establish new team practices
* Follow up with contacts at other agencies who mentioned possible resources for the repository to begin evaluating those

## Challenges / Blockers 

* Julia was in training 12h last week; Mike was attending additional strategy meetings 
* We are still waiting for an engineer to be staffed; ideally, they would start 1/21
