# February 15, 2019

We’ve completed our first sprint since getting back from the shutdown and have been busy pushing forward with our work with our partners at FNS and state agencies as well as working towards alignment on an overarching vision of success.

## Completed

* Began collaborating with [Colyar](http://colyar.com) (one of the big vendors that states work with)
* Conducted four [interviews with state departments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pggM2KMBDyN-p_-fN9tzgsvHcA7UdqgSqlmnJADP6mY/edit#gid=0) of education to understand their FNS-742 process in order to further inform the development of our tool
* Conducted goal-setting session facilitated by Elizabeth Ayer (Mural; summary)
* Shared [learnings from user interviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLf52Fmg_JDUmQso7bKNY_W-RK9i81MbDSgJqy9oOu0/edit) in Kansas 
* Calls with potential use case contacts at VA, CMS, performance.gov
* Worked with FNS to solve mismatches between their edit checks and our tool
* Performed tests using data provided by FNS (from school year 2013 to 2017) to ensure tool’s results are correct
* Planned [next sprint](https://github.com/18F/data-federation-project/projects/3) 

## Up Next

* Go through existing leads on use cases and identify a second use case for our Phase 3 work
   * Follow up with FNS, CDC, DOT, DOJ, Ed
* Based on resources left in Phase 3, and based on previous goal-setting session, identify specific areas of delivery for Phase 3
* Identify challenges / requirements for long term support & maintenance of data validation service for FNS
* Continue to make improvement to the tool to serve the need for FNS use case

## Questions / Blockers

* Waiting on publication of [blog post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10V9RV8QxjfjGcropwY_39JNUV-vV6MXqccGYSsgeOn0/edit#heading=h.ygglxjnto8hk) on the 18F blog to promote the U.S. Data Federation and solicit additional use cases
* Better understand of what Phase 4 10X looks like & process to get there.
