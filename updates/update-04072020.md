# April 7, 2020

We are heading into our second-to-last sprint as a fully-staffed team and are looking forward to seeing a lot of work come to fruition over the next month. The team’s focus is finalizing the content, structure, and design for the new release of resources.data.gov (r.d.g) as well as continuing to pursue long-term support for the work. 

## Completed
* **Resources.data.gov**
  * Tested categories and tagging structure with all the current resources in Mural in order to evaluate our taxonomy and navigation and inform structure and design
  * Recommended resources for deletion from r.d.g
  * Created a fork of resources.data.gov in the 18F Github for prototyping purposes
  * Successfully tested three approaches to authoring content for the repository; made preliminary decision to go with the 3rd approach for our initial import of resources and then use Netlify going forward
    * By spreadsheet that is imported into the repo directly to create individual pages per resource
    * By using Netlify as a CMS to create new resources in r.d.g
    * By using a script to import records from the spreadsheet into Netlify
  * Finalized MVP content model for resource summaries and individual resources
  * Received and synthesized 8 responses to our taxonomy card-sort activity
  * Determined the following as the content to be added in the new release of r.d.g: 
    * CDO Charter Template (WIP in collaboration with the CoEs)
    * Federal Data Strategy Proof Points
    * SSA Data Governance Board Example
* **Future of U.S. Data Federation**
  * Received extremely helpful feedback and pricing information from Jay Huie which has begun to transform the vision statement into an official proposal
  * Got clarity on communications approval processes around resources by speaking with Dahianna Salazar-Foreman and Krista Britt — some of the takeaways: 
    * Linking to an already published, publicly-accessible government-created resource is fine
    * We should be careful not to suggest that any “how-to” or recommendation could be construed as official guidance—the repository is surfacing options rather than prescribing a course of action
    * If publishing a resource created by another agency, ensure that that agency’s comms team has signed off and given approval. 


## Up next

* **Resources.data.gov** 
  * Finalize structure for files and navigation of r.d.g and get feedback/validation (from Data.gov / r.d.g stakeholders)
  * Define page/content structures for r.d.g (to begin coding)
  * Draft website copy 
  * Finalize MVP styles / design 
  * Understand & initiate approval process for website copy and design changes
  * Finalize CDO Charter Template with Eric Ewing
  * Refine list of resources that could be pursued by future teams 
  * Update r.d.g stakeholders
* **Future of U.S. Data Federation**
  * Finalize proposal
  * Formulate specific plan for immediate post-10x work
  * Identify the steps towards proposal approval and resource allocation

## Challenges / Blockers 
The coronavirus crisis continues to affect our ability to get feedback and conduct user research as stakeholders and partners are forced to reprioritize. We feel limited in our ability to secure a future for this work without more input and situational awareness around planning, budgeting, and the realities of resourcing.
