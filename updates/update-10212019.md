The U.S. Data Federation is back for Phase 4! Our work in Phase 4 falls into two primary workstreams: (1) supporting resources.data.gov and (2) continued work on ReVAL. Currently staffed by Julia Lindpaintner (UX Research & Design) and Mike Gintz (Strategy), the first few weeks of this phase have been focused on reestablishing contact with collaborators from Phase 3. 

## Completed

* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov 
  * Reviewed documentation on resources.data.gov website and in the related legislation and Federal Data Strategy Action Plan; revisited Phase 4 pitch materials
  * Held internal ramp-up conversation with data.gov team to learn about the status of work on resources.data.gov
  * Identified broader set of stakeholders for next direction-setting meeting
*  Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Reestablished contact with Phase 3 partners
    * Christian Moscardi at Census Bureau 
    * Nate Deshmukh Towery of the WZDx project
  * Explored data journey archetypes
    * Talked to colleagues involved in data-centric projects (with NIH, TANF, eApp) and documented the observed data journeys in order to validate an abstracted model based on previous conversations
  * Got up to speed on progress on the USDA/FNS Data Validation Service
    * Amy Mok and Tadhg O'Higgins provided invaluable support to our partners at FNS as they moved to production

## Up next

* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov 
  * Schedule a meeting with the broader set of stakeholders in order to:
    * Surface participants' expectations and beliefs around r.d.g.
    * Identify invisible boundaries/parameters/constraints around r.d.g.
    * Articulate a vision of success for r.d.g.
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Identify next steps, open questions, and key dependencies for ReVAL work
  * Meet with FNS partners to discuss transition planning

##Challenges / Blockers 

* The ramp up for Phase 4 has been a bit slow as we try to orient ourselves to existing conversations and processes and find the right points of contact. We see a meeting with the broader stakeholder group engaged in the resources.data.gov work as a key first step to being able to contribute effectively and are working to get this scheduled asap.
