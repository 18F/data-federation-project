Throughout this project, we’ve had a clear mission statement for the U.S. Data Federation: an effort to support reusable tools and repeatable processes for federated data projects. Last week, we presented a vision for the long-term practical manifestation of the U.S. Data Federation: The content strategy team underpinning resources.data.gov. We look forward to using the remainder of Phase 4 funding to prototype the team, content sourcing, and content structure for the resource repository.

## Completed

* Submitted [staffing request](https://github.com/18F/staffing/issues/689) for full-time content strategy and engineering capabilities to be added to the team in early 2020
* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov repository
  * Conducted a few more interviews and investigated potential funding opportunities for the U.S. Data Federation beyond Phase 4
  * Presented to resources.data.gov and 10x stakeholders: Reported back on research conducted, described vision long-term for the U.S. Data Federation, and outlined next steps for the remainder of Phase 4
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Followed up with pilot partners
    * FNS team needs our help making sure that states are not mistakenly accessing the 18F/10x sandbox for the Data Validation Service
    * WZDx is planning the publication of their v2 specification and seeking internal resources to update the validation tool
    * Census partners are continuing to work on the tool for the Commodity Flow Survey and have submitted a proposal for an additional project that would build on top of ReVAL

  
## Up next

* Plan to onboard new team members
* Define project tasks for remainder of Phase 4
* Work with 10x team to define timeline and scope of work for Flexion contractors 
* Schedule follow-up conversation with OMB stakeholders to address opportunities to collaborate with CDO Council and Federal Data Strategy
* Schedule conversations with the states who implemented the USDA FNS Data Validation Service (DVS) this fall to capture their experiences


## Challenges / Blockers 

The 10x Data Fed team is mostly on holiday break until 1/6/2020. Happy New Year!
