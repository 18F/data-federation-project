The past two weeks have been full of stakeholder and user interviews to learn about the data management challenges a hypothetical resource repository could meet and the audiences it could serve.

## Completed

* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov repository
  * Conducted interviews with 14 individuals across 7 agencies, including direct resources.data.gov stakeholders, CDOs, and other players in the federal data management and governance space
  * Began synthesis of research findings
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Scheduled initial conversation with a user of the WZDx ReVAL instantiation
  * Contributed summaries of the Data Federation and ReVAL work to the 10x Project Showcase and TTS Success Stories documents
  
## Up next

* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov repository
  * Conduct additional and follow-up conversations with stakeholders and users
  * Prepare a synthesis of research findings to share with r.d.g core stakeholders
  * Begin to define the future of the U.S. Data Federation involvement with r.d.g
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Make a determination about Amy Mok’s availability to rejoin the U.S. Data Federation project to continue work on ReVAL


## Challenges / Blockers 

The combination of a focus skewed towards research around the repository and slow responses from our ReVAL user contacts led to little progress on Workstream 2 over the course of the past two weeks. The two work streams continue to compete for attention in Phase 4, but as long as we have a hope of Amy returning to the project, we are less inclined to push on the ReVAL line of work.
