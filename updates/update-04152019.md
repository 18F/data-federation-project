With four sprints left, we are working to ensure the future viability of each part of the U.S. Data Federation project. That means doing research and building alignment around a strong case for Phase 4 funding, engaging with additional partners strategically, transitioning FNS to a new agreement, and continuing to upgrade our tool.
## Completed

* Defined requirements for satisfying our “second use case”
* Defined our desired terms of engagement with two additional partners
  * DOT: Work Zone Data Exchange — We will use this case to prove out the reusability of our tool by upgrading to allow for schema validation
  * Census: Commodity Flow Survey — We will provide support to an internal developer who will build a prototype as a way to learn what support and documentation is needed
* Created interview template to guide conversations with Federal Data Strategy proof point subjects and other use cases
* Updated [website](https://federation.data.gov/) to align messaging across platforms 
* Aligned with Eligibility Rules Service team on Phase 4 pitch planning
* Clarified phase 4 pitch expectations with 10x team
* Finished work on variable substitution for FNS Data Validation Service to allow chosen precision display
* Started work on modularizing Validator in Django data ingest to allow for easier subclassing
* Generated ideas for a new name for the reusable [Django data ingest](https://github.com/18F/django-data-ingest) module


## Up Next

* Schedule interviews with previous contacts and proof point partners
* Circulate a few possible name directions for consideration
* Align on and share a cost estimate with FNS for work with 18F
* Continue work on modularizing Validator in Django data ingest to allow for easier subclassing
* Focus on documenting in preparation of the developer’s guide for FNS
* Start work on creating a JSON Schema Validator
* Begin supporting Census partner in the creation of a prototype


## Questions / Blockers

* Sporadic and unreliable communication from states working on the implementation of the USDA/FNS Data Validation Service
