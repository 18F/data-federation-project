Sprint 2 was short, but sweet. We made meaningful progress defining an audience to target for our MVP, developing a potential taxonomy and site maps, identifying a content structure for open source software, refactoring ReVAL, and sketching out content development approaches. The highlight of the sprint was hearing from Kansas, Arizona, and Louisiana’s teams who had implemented the FNS Data Validation Service.

## Completed
* **Resources.data.gov**
  * Defined our (MVP) audience as Chief Data Officers and their support staff
  * Consolidated previous “Jobs To Be Done” and potential content lists into the overarching resources.data.gov content inventory
  * Developed draft site maps and potential resource groupings
  * Identified a potential content structure for tools through an audit of open source project sites and tested it with ReVAL
  * Drafted reusability checklist for open source tools
  * High-level UX audit of current site to note opportunities for improvements
* **ReVAL**
  * Began the process of refactoring ReVAL to pull the functionality from the UI into the API to establish ReVAL's "core"
  * Interviewed states who have implemented the FNS DVS and documented benefits described (time savings, data quality improvements, etc) and shared in #why-we-do-this 
  * Presented to USDA’s Continuous Process Improvement Community of Practice on the FNS DVS, ReVAL, and the U.S. Data Federation project
* **Future of U.S. Data Federation**
  * Continued to develop the proposal section of the vision statement for the U.S. Data Federation 

## Up next

* **Resources.data.gov** 
  * Complete an MVP taxonomy for r.d.g
  * Complete MVP mockups of key page types for r.d.g 
  * Confirm which resources we will develop during Phase 4
  * Assess feasibility of desired features/capabilities for r.d.g
* **ReVAL** 
  * Complete the refactoring work on ReVAL 
  * Prototype a page for ReVAL on r.d.g
* **Future of U.S. Data Federation**
  * Write a blog post describing the outcomes of the FNS DVS pilot
