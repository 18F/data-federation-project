Having expanded our team, we are launching into our first sprint. We have defined four work streams and come up with overarching goals in each. We look forward to initiating work on a content audit of resources.data.gov, reinitiating work on ReVAL, and continuing conversations with potential partners on content for resources.data.gov.

*Note: Now that we’re working in more defined sprints, we plan to publish shipping news after each sprint planning session. Since our sprints are running Wed-Tues, updates will likely come on Wed or Thurs in the future.*
