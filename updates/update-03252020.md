ReVal is done! Huge thanks and kudos to James Tranovich for getting this over the finish line. The reusable validation tool is now refactored and the documentation has been built out to provide more examples and support to future users. Next step: Get that beauty published on resources.data.gov!

  * Found alternatives to FEMA content and continued conversations with Bethany Blakey, Eric Ewing, and Laura Train
  * Decided to build the “new” r.d.g on top of the existing site rather than starting from scratch
  * Created high-level mockups to explore design approaches to the homepage, resource lists, and resource pages for r.d.g
 inventory

## Challenges / Blockers 
The state of the world is affecting everyone. We are trying to move forward on the project work—which is so far unaffected—with patience, kindness, and understanding for our partners’ shifting priorities and our own.
