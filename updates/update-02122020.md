Having expanded our team, we are launching into our first sprint. We have defined four work streams and come up with overarching goals in each. We look forward to initiating work on a content audit of resources.data.gov, reinitiating work on ReVAL, and continuing conversations with potential partners on content for resources.data.gov.

*Note: Now that we’re working in more defined sprints, we plan to publish shipping news after each sprint planning session. Since our sprints are running Wed-Tues, updates will likely come on Wed or Thurs in the future.*  


## Completed
* **Resources.data.gov**
  * Completed content audit for r.d.g
  * Spoke with potential content sources and started to create criteria to reduce the number of partners we engage with
  * Assessed the EPA Metadata Editor tool and concluded that the Phase 4 team should not invest in abstracting it, but might be able to showcase it another way on r.d.g
  * Aaron Borden introduced team to r.d.g repository, structure, and processes
  * Conducted an initial survey of analogous websites to identify design patterns
* **ReVAL**
  * Pushed bug fixes to ReVAL and pruned issue log
  * Released ReVAL v0.6.2
  * Prioritized remaining tasks for ReVAL to focus on clean up and rearchitecting, not developing the UI or other new features
* **Future of U.S. Data Federation**
  * Prepared a draft vision statement and shared with 10x and Phil Ashlock for feedback 



  
## Up next

* **Resources.data.gov** 
  * Define our (MVP) audience
  * Draft site map & content model
  * Start to develop content model for open source tools
* **ReVAL** 
  * Begin the process of refactoring ReVAL to pull the functionality from the UI into the API to establish ReVAL's "core"
  * Interview states who have implemented the FNS DVS to learn about challenges and impact of the service
* **Future of U.S. Data Federation**
  * Identify key decision-makers for continued funding and build out proposal section of the vision statement with this audience in mind 
  * Further articulate risk mitigation strategies in our risk tracker


## Challenges / Blockers 

* We have a lot of leads for folks to partner with on developing content, but we need to make sure that we are not spread too thin and can meaningfully test our hypothesis for a future content creation strategy
