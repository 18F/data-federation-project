# April 1, 2019

Our team is growing and our vision is becoming ever clearer. This sprint, we‚Äôll take a step back to define an MVP for our second use case, set parameters around our outreach efforts, and try to answer that all-important question: What is the thing?*

## Completed

* Welcomed Mike to the team! üéâ
* Website update recommendations 
* Calls with 
  * Federal Data Strategy, to align on how our work can/should relate
  * Technology Modernization Fund, to establish whether that is a viable source of funding for parts of our project
  * 10x team, to understand more about Phase 4 funding / pitch planning
  * Past and potential collaborators: Frictionless Data, FGDC, Justin Stekervetz (NIEM, DATA Act), 18F Biz Dev, Open Referral
  * Eligibility Rules Service team, to compare notes on business model/long-term planning
* Follow-up conversations & technical investigation for 2 candidates for our ‚Äú2nd use case‚Äù 
  * Census: Commodity Flow Survey ‚Äî use our tool to validate, aggregate, and potentially automatically code input from users
  * DOT: Work Zone Data Exchange ‚Äî use our tool to validate adherence to a new specification for work zone data
* Continued work on variable substitution for FNS Data Validation Service
  * Currently supporting basic arithmetic operations
* Started work on creating a project template to make it easier for new users to start a new data ingest project
  * Dockerized the project template


## Up Next

* Engage with Federal Data Strategy to follow up with their identified proof points
* Define the MVP for demonstrating reusability of our tool
* Naming session for the ‚ÄúDjango Data Ingest‚Äù 
* Continue conversation around ATO and long-term planning with FNS
* Implement updates to website
* Continue work on variable substitution for FNS Data Validation Service to allow chosen precision display
* Continue work on the project template
* Explore implementing a base validator that can make new customized validator easier to create by user
* Continue with technical investigation for 2nd use case


## Questions / Blockers

* Little communication from states as to their expected timeline or challenges implementing the FNS Data Validation Service; their progress will significantly impact the level of support FNS will require beyond Phase 3

*The thing we want to define is what the reusable, generally-accessible version of the Django data ingest tool is‚Äîwhat it does, who uses it, and where it lives.
