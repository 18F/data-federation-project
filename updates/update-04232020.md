It’s the final countdown! We are into our last sprint and are all working to ensure that content, design, and development are in lockstep with one another so that we can meet our target of delivering a ready-to-relaunch resources.data.gov at the end of this project! We continue to nudge the conversation about eventual home and funding for this work forward as best we can.
