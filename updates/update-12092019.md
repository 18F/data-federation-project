# December 9, 2019

Over the past few weeks we have continued to conduct research and learn more about the relationship between the Evidence Act, the Federal Data Strategy, and other ongoing efforts around data sharing. We are finishing up our last scheduled user and stakeholder interviews this week, synthesize our findings, and articulate some tangible recommendations for next steps in Phase 4.
## Completed

* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov repository
  * By the end of this week, we will have spoken with more than 30 individuals, including direct resources.data.gov stakeholders, CDOs, those involved in the Federal Data Strategy and other players in the federal data management and governance space
  * Continued synthesis and began to formulate a vision for the evolution of the resource repository
  * Began to evaluate possible long-term sustainment strategies
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Spoke with a user of the WZDx ReVAL instantiation and advocated for funding to be specifically allocated to update the tool to the forthcoming v.2.0 of the specification
  * Determined that Amy Mok would not be able to continue on Data Federation until the new year at the earliest
  
## Up next

* Workstream 1: Resources.data.gov repository
  * Report back on research conducted to resources.data.gov stakeholders
  * Present a proposal for next steps with 10x funding
  * Learn more about potential funding mechanisms for this work within OMB and GSA
* Workstream 2: ReVAL
  * Follow up with FNS team to learn more about how the Data Validation Service (DVS) has been going in production
  * Schedule conversations with the states who implemented the DVS this fall to capture their experiences
  * Determine what (if any) engineering resources will be needed in 2020

## Challenges / Blockers 

The busy pre-holiday and pre-Federal Data Strategy Year One Action Plan launch schedules may make it hard to convene the resources.data.gov stakeholders in one meeting, potentially delaying our ability to get buy-in on next steps for our team.
